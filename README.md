# To-do-website
this is a website I have created, which is a very simple version of Trello.com, you can add tasks which you need to accomplish, the task can be either a business task, or a personal task, the website uses Local Storage (aka browser data) to store the tasks you have placed. 

you can use it at todo.glqch.dev

Warning: your tasks will be deleted if you reset the site's data!
